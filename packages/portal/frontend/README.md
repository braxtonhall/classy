# Portal Frontend



## Dev Instructions

This assumes you're working with WebStorm.

1) Change into `portal/frontend/`

2) Run WebPack (bundles TS into JS for the browser): `webpack --watch`

3) Start `portal/backend` (probably in WebStorm so you can set breakpoints etc); details about configuring/running the backend can be found in `docs/developer/bootstrap.md`

4) Navigate to `https://localhost:3000` in your browser. This may require the `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost` be enabled, if you are using Chrome.
